# jsonCV
This is an elaborate JSON schema to electronically share CVs (resumes) across systems. These systems can be automated where they process the CVs in JSON format and share the same to other systems or applications. Or they can be mobile or web applications providing a view of the parsed JSON which represents a CV of a person.
